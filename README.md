# StockPredictor

We aim to predict the future prices of any given stock, using previous data. We will use months of historical prices for the stocks, which can be easily downloaded from yahoo finance. The code uses the scikit-learn machine learning library to train our predictive model on the stock price dataset to forecast future prices.

The following Machine Learning Libraries will be used: -
*(a) csv: will allow us to read data from CSV files of stock prices that we obtain/download from Yahoo Finance 
*(b) numpy: will let us perform calculations on the stock price data that we downloaded
*(c) scikit-learn: will allow us to build a predictive model for our algorithm 
*(d) matplotlib: will let us plot our data-points with our model on a graph for us to analyze which can be deduced as the outcome.
We will be needing a dataset of stock prices from past 30 days with each day’s opening and closing prices. This can be obtained from Yahoo Finance (website) in the form of a CSV file for any company’s stock we choose to analyze.
